Borderlands 2 Soundboard Android Application
============================================

This is a simple Borderlands 2 soundboard application. 
It features the notifications and ringtones .mp3 files that GearboxSoftware 
posted on their website, which consist of over 400 quotes from Moxxi, Tiny Tina, Torgue, Sir Hammerlock, and Claptrap. 
In addition, it contains soundbites from the 6 Vault Hunters, Scooter, and Handsome Jack, which I parsed myself. 
The app keeps track of play count and is able to compile a stats overview of the user's activity. 
Lastly, the app also supports the setting of any of the audio files as the user's ringtone.
