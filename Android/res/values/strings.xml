	<!-- About -->
	<string name="about_text">Hello fellow Vault Hunter and thank you for downloading 
	    				 my Borderlands 2 soundboard! Before you delve into the wonderful audio 
	    				 world of Pandora, here are some quick tips to help you use 
	    				 this app:\n\n
	    				 - The single note icon in the action bar acts as a \"random\" button. 
	    				 The pool of files from which it draws on corresponds to the page you\'re currently on.
	    				 \n\n- Hold/long click on a file to set it as your ringtone or notification tone.
	    				 \n\n- Click on the stars to favorite/unfavorite files.
	    				 \n\n- Search for nothing to bring back full lists of files.
	    				 \n\n- If you go to the \"Stats\" page, you\'ll see that you have a rank based on how 
	    				 much you\'ve used this app. Because I\'m evil, it\'s up to you to figure out 
	    				 the number of ranks I\'ve created and how to reach each one. Happy playing!
	    				 \n\nAnd that\'s it! Now Claptrap commands you to leave a rating/review to help 
	    				 out a poor full-time college student who hacks together free, ad-less 
	    				 Android apps in his spare time.
	    				 \n\nIf you super care about when the next updates are coming for my apps, feel 
	    				 free to check out my derpy blog here: http://alexsdevblog.blogspot.com/
