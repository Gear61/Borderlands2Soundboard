A golden mallet for the meat pounding
A killing tool. PUT IT IN ME
ALL I SEE IS REEEEED
Blood blood blooood blood bloooood
GET STYLED UPON
I can't stop it... I can't stop the killing, AND I DON'T WANT TO
I feel a deep, dark warmth
I like my treasure like I like my baby steaks... raaaaare
I'll slice your eyelids so you can't watch the end
I'LL TAKE YOU ALL WITH ME
I'm here to shank and smile
I'm losing blood... GIVE ME YOURS
I SWALLOWED YOUR SOUL
It's time to bleed
It's time to go insane
I wanna crush something
[Laughs] What a shiny soul stabber
LIFE. IS. PAIN
Look at that pungent killstick
[Maniacal Laughter]
Mhmm, my pecs have pecs
My axe is thirsty
NIPPLE SALADS. Nipple Salads. NIPPLE SALADS
Nuhuh, you can't stop me
RAMPAGE AND FILL THE RED BAR
RAMPAGE TIME
SHUT UP
STOP DYING AT ME
Swing the axe, drink the health
Who's ready to flay some scalps
